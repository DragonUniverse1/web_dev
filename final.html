        <p style="text-align: center;">Utah is a wonderuful place to go for vacation/holiday. But you don't know where to go or what to do. Lucky for you, I can help! If you are okay with thrill, excitment, large crowds, and rollercoasters, Lagoon is the best place for your vacation! This place is filled with family friendly rides. It also has rides to do on a date or hang out with your friend group. Every year their theme of the park changes. Such as, during halloween, they decorate the place to be halloween theme. Though unfortunately, they do not allow things with costumes to be on such as Face make-up, costumes, or Halloween masks.</p>
