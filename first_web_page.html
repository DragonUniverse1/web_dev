        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The begining</h2>
        <p>This is the new Utopia. The beginning of it all. How a Utopia started and ended to Dystopian. It starts back to when we had magic. Powers. Freedom. Exept someone didn't believe in how it all worked. Acrasia. He turned on everyone. Some believed he went crazy. Some believed he wanted to be banished on purpose. And some believe, he wanted more power. To today, we stil are unsure to why or how he has decided to do what he did. But his consequence to disrespecting and breaking the rules that you might call a law, ended with him banished. Even then, he came back after around six months of leaving our town. This time, he was worse. He tried to convince people to come with him in a very forceful and manipulative way. He told them there was a better society. Most people disagreed. Some people were under too much pressure, they decided to follow him. Acrasia was able to convince some. But it wasn't enough for him. The high ranked evighed, or evighedens, couldn't take him with his behavior, as well as the lower ranks. Many many people of the evighed gathered to the center of the town where we held reports. We made sure Acrasia was with us, up front. Made sure he wouldn't speak. Little did we know, he was going to comit violence. We wouldn't let him. His punishment was one of the worst punishments the evigheds believed would be the best option for him. We removed his sharp pointy ears to round, sharp claws to dull, canine teeth shaping to be smaller, and they removed his abilities of powers. The wise ranked people told the crowed that if they followed him, they better speak up now and be banished forever with the same consequenses as him, or lie to them and follow him if he decides to try to escape. Just from that major scene, more and more people decided to follow his footsteps and become his followers. We threw Acrasia into an underground prison, and everyone else who wanted to follow him, were removed of their traits the evigheds find the most fasinating and unique traits we have. Until later, Acrasia escaped again. Crazy how that happens a second time but with help of the followers who lied to the rest of us.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">War after many generations</h2>

        <p>After a few several years of this chaos against the new <em>revolution</em> they called it. They taunted us from outside the town, the prisions... They were everywhere. We couldn't handle it. Acrasia knew this. Possibly even one of the entities were helping. People started to get nightmares from nothing. It all just started to happen. Weeks after this phenomenon has been going on, a giant fire attacked our town. Gunshots and other strange things caused it. Someone did catch one of the banished call it machine or technology. There were too many rumors happening, it was hard to know what was right and what was wrong. Even those who had the ability to tell what is the truth and what is not. Back to the attack they caused, we had no choice but to fight them back. We didn't want to kill them. But in some ways we had not much of a choice. This turned into a war that lasted for at least 2-5 years. Yes, it took us that long to finally figure out a way to not kill anybody, but still prevent from this happening. Though durring those few years of this revolution, many families and people decided to try and leave without getting killed. We lost barely more than half of our town and residents. This was officially one of the worst and stupid ways to get into a war or revolution. Nobody cared at this point, all we really wanted was to end this stupid thing. No more violence, no more trying to take over, no more manipulation towards our entire economy. What we have finally decided to do, was to create a new island far away from this wretched place. This was going to be dificult. Especially that these no longer Evighed', have already created their own economy from a decent distance away, accourding to some of the spies we used to figure out what they were planning. Most never came back, obviously. But some infromation from someone who is most trustworthy, is better. What we need to do is remove that brand new economy, to a new decently big island, that way they can leave us alone as long as we manipulate their minds to forgetting that us and magic ever existed. Many many days have passed, we've taken some people prisoner, in order to transport them to the new island. We were succesful after a very long long long time.</p>
