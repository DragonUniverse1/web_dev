        <h1>The Utopia and Dystopia story</h1>
        <h2>The begining</h2>
        <p>This is the new Utopia. The beginning of it all. How a Utopia started and ended to Dystopian. It starts back to when we had magic. Powers. Freedom. Exept someone didn't believe in how it all worked. Acrasia. He turned on everyone. Some believed he went crazy. Some believed he wanted to be banished on purpose. And some believe, he wanted more power. To today, we stil are unsure to why or how he has decided to do what he did. But his consequence to disrespecting and breaking the rules that you might call a law, ended with him banished. Even then, he came back after around six months of leaving our town. This time, he was worse. He tried to convince people to come with him in a very forceful and manipulative way. He told them there was a better society. Most people disagreed. Some people were under too much pressure, they decided to follow him. Acrasia was able to convince some. But it wasn't enough for him. The high ranked evighed, or evighedens, couldn't take him with his behavior, as well as the lower ranks. Many many people of the evighed gathered to the center of the town where we held reports. We made sure Acrasia was with us, up front. Made sure he wouldn't speak. Little did we know, he was going to comit violence. We wouldn't let him. His punishment was one of the worst punishments the evigheds believed would be the best option for him. We removed his sharp pointy ears to round, sharp claws to dull, canine teeth shaping to be smaller, and they removed his abilities of powers. The wise ranked people told the crowed that if they followed him, they better speak up now and be banished forever with the same consequenses as him, or lie to them and follow him if he decides to try to escape. Just from that major scene, more and more people decided to follow his footsteps and become his followers. We threw Acrasia into an underground prison, and everyone else who wanted to follow him, were removed of their traits the evigheds find the most fasinating and unique traits we have. Until later, Acrasia escaped again. Crazy how that happens a second time but with help of the followers who lied to the rest of us.</p>
