        <h1>The Utopia and Dystopia story</h1>
        <h2>The begining</h2>
        <p>This is the new Utopia. The beinging of it all. How a Utopia started and ended to Dystopian. It starts back to when we had magic. Powers. Freedom. Exept someone didn't belive in how it all worked. Acrasia. He turned on everyone. Some belived he went crazy. Some belived he wanted to be banished on purpose. And some belive, he wanted more power. To today, we stil are unsure to why or how he has decided to do what he did. But his consequence to disrespecting and breaking the rules that you might call a law, ended with him banished. Even then, he came back after around six months of leaving our town. This time, he was worse. He tried to convince people to come with him. To a better society. Most people said no. Some people were under too much pressure, they decided to follow him. Acrasia was able to convince some. But it wasn't enough for him. The high ranked people couldn't take him with his behavior, as well as the lower ranks. Many many people gathered to the center of the town where we held reports.</p>
