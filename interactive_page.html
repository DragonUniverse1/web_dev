        <h1>About Capybara 0-0</h1>
        <p>Capybara. Accourding to a lot of research, capybaras are the most chill and friendliest animals on the planet. they can hang out with literally any kind of animal by choice since they are also very social animals, and not get killed. Most of the time, when they hang out with aligators or crocodiles, they don't usually do anything since they know it isn't worth it. How it isn't worth it for the gators, is because capybaras can run up to around 35mph.</p>
