    <h1>FERRETS *O*</h1>
    <div id="content-wrapper">
    <div id="left">
    <p>The name ferret is derived from the Late Latin furittus, meaning 'little thief', a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small items. In Old English (Anglo-Saxon), the animal was called mearþ. The word fyret seems to appear in Middle English in the 14th century from the Latin, with the modern spelling of ferret by the 16th century. Ferrets spend 14 to 18 hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are crepuscular. If they are caged, they should be taken out daily to exercise and satisfy their curiosity; they need at least an hour and a place to play. Unlike their polecat ancestors, which are solitary animals, most ferrets will live happily in social groups. They are territorial, like to burrow, and prefer to sleep in an enclosed area.</p>
